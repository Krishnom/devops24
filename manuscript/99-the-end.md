**Joost van der Griendt** is one of those people that embrace a challenge wholeheartedly. We worked together for the same customer and quickly established a great relationship. From there on, he started helping me with discussions and advice on the subjects I worked on. Later on, he began contributing to this book. So was so proactive and helpful that at moments I could not keep up with his pull requests. Just when I would think that I'm done for the day, I'd see a new pull request with more questions, changes, additions, and corrections. It's partly his fault that I did not get enough sleep.

In his own words...

*Joost started out a Java backend developer but found himself fascinated by developer productivity through tools like Jenkins and Maven. Inspired by Viktor's books and Workshops, he moved his attention to Docker, Cloud, and DevOps to the point where he joined CloudBees to help spread the knowledge.*
