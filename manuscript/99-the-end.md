# Now It's Your Turn

I showed you a very opinionated way of doing continuous delivery and continuous deployment using Jenkins in a Kubernetes cluster. I did not try to strike a balance and teach you everything you could do. I don't believe that balanced unopinionated writings are a good thing. I do not like to read an article or a book that compares different ways of doing something only to conclude with "they all have their pros and cons." To me, that's silly. I like to know how someone does something. I have no interest in wasting my time reading a comparison that tries to be "politically correct" so that no one gets offended. In my head, that's a sign that a writer is a spineless person that does not have a personal opinion nor real experience. Spending enough time with a technology or a process inevitably leads to opinions. "I tried this and that, I failed, I succeeded, and this is what, in my opinion, works best." Those are the types of writings I like to read, and those are the people I admire. I tried to follow the same logic. As a result, I gave you what I think works the best for me today (August 2018).

That being said, I'd love to get your point of view. I'd like to get my hands on your pipelines. They will inevitably be different than the ones I promoted in this book. Otherwise, I failed to convey the most important message. **Learn something new, combine it with your existing knowledge, and adapt it to your own needs. Never follow anything or anyone blindly.** Hopefully, you found at least parts of this book useful, you learned something new, and you adapted your existing processes. Please send me what you created. I want to see your processes and your pipelines. Even more, I'd love to work with you to publish them in a blog or as an appendix to this book. If you think you did something interesting, as I'm sure you did, please contact me on [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack and show me what you created. **You learned from others, now it's time for others to learn from you.**

**I'm done explaining what I did, now it's your turn to share what you made.**

# Contributions

Like the previous books, this one was also a collaboration effort. Many helped shape this book through discussions, notes, and bug reports. I was swarmed with comments through [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack (often private) messages and emails. The conversations I had with the readers of the early editions of the book influenced the end result significantly. I'm grateful to have such a great community behind me. **Thank you for helping me make this book great.**

A few rose above the crowd.

**Joost van der Griendt** is one of those people that embrace a challenge wholeheartedly. We worked together for the same customer and quickly established a great relationship. From there on, he started helping me with discussions and advice on the subjects I worked on. Later on, he began contributing to this book. At times he was so proactive and helpful that I could not keep up with his pull requests. Just when I would think that I'm done for the day, I'd see a new pull request with more questions, changes, additions, and corrections.

In his own words...

*Joost started out a Java backend developer but found himself fascinated by developer productivity through tools like Jenkins and Maven. Inspired by Viktor's books and Workshops, he moved his attention to Docker, Cloud, and DevOps to the point where he joined CloudBees to help spread the knowledge.*

**Prageeth Warnak** was continually sending pull requests with corrections and suggestions. He made this book much clearer than it would be if I had to rely on my, often incorrect, assumptions of what readers expect.

In his own words...

*Prageeth is a seasoned IT professional currently working as the lead software architect for Australian telco giant Telstra. He enjoys working with new technologies, and he likes spending his leisure time reading books (especially those written by Viktor), watching Netflix and Fox news, yes he is an originalist and a conservative. He lives in Melbourne with his family. He is fascinated getting Microservices and DevOps done right.*

**Neeraj Kothari** - Reviews, suggestions, windows testing, etc.

In his own words...

*Neeraj is an architect who mostly works with American banks. New technologies excite him, and that makes him learn all the time. He likes to analyze and connect the dots in the fast-changing technology world. He is passionate about Microservices and DevOps. He likes to read, daydream and watch movies, His favorite author is Malcolm Gladwell.*


**Tigran Mnatsakanyan**, just like many others, contributed with corrections, advice, suggestions, and the like. We spent hours in discussions around Kubernetes, Jenkins, and CI/CD. He influenced the content of this books greatly. But, that's not his most significant contribution. He was brave enough to volunteer to write a whole chapter. It is still in progress so I won't give away spoilers, except to say that this edition will be updated as soon as Tigran's chapter is finished.

In his own words...

*Tigran is a technologist who works as an independent contractor in London helping teams with technology and ways of working. He started as a Java developer then moved to functional programming using numerous architectural styles and patterns. At some point, he realized that in almost every team writing application code takes less time than everything else afterward, and he started to explore and learn more about the world of Microservices, DevOps, and Docker. And of course, he loves reading Viktor's books!*
