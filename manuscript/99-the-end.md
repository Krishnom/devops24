**Joost van der Griendt** is one of those people that embrace a challenge wholeheartedly. We worked together for the same customer and quickly established a great relationship. From there on, he started helping me with discussions and advice on the subjects I worked on. Later on, he began contributing to this book. At times he was so proactive and helpful that I could not keep up with his pull requests. Just when I would think that I'm done for the day, I'd see a new pull request with more questions, changes, additions, and corrections. It's partly his fault that I did not get enough sleep.

In his own words...

*Joost started out a Java backend developer but found himself fascinated by developer productivity through tools like Jenkins and Maven. Inspired by Viktor's books and Workshops, he moved his attention to Docker, Cloud, and DevOps to the point where he joined CloudBees to help spread the knowledge.*

**Prageeth Warnak** was continually sending pull requests with corrections and suggestions. He made this book much clearer than it would be if I had to rely on my, often incorrect, assumptions of what readers expect.

Prageeth is a seasoned IT professional currently working as the lead software architect for Australian telco giant Telstra. He enjoys working with new technologies, and he likes spending his leisure time reading books (especially those written by Viktor), watching Netflix and Fox news,yes he is a originalist and a conservative. He lives in Melbourne with his family. He is fascinated getting Microservices and DevOps done right.
